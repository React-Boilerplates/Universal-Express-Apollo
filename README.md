## What a Boilerplate isn't that like totally 2015

I was trying to use other cli/generators and was coming up against some blockers... many of them try to extract away too much.  Next.js makes it hard to create an initializer so that they have a better page building experience.  As a result things like `redux` are VERY hacky to implement by using wrappers.  Things like `create-react-app` are not SSR by default.  Also getting styling implemented in these are a serious pain in the tuckus.  I wanted to build an app that allows for production quality build with modern standards like `graphql` by default.

Take a look and contribute if you would like.  The goal of this is to use modern standards.
